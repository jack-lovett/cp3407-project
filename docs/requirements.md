# 1) Requirements

## Goal
Define a complete set of **user stories** (more than will fit into Iteration 1 & 2), each with:
- priority (with justification)
- estimate (with notes / planning poker evidence)
- acceptance criteria

## Where requirements live
- Summary checklist: `../User_stories.md`
- Individual user stories: `../user_stories/`

## Next steps (short)
- Decide our **personas** (customer vs restaurant vs driver/admin)
- Capture our **USP** (what makes FeedMe “better than FoodPanda”)
- Write 12–20 user stories + prioritise for Iteration 1 & 2
