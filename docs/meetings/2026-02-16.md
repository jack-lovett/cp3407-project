# Meeting Notes — 2026-02-16

## Context
- Most progress today was made using a single device with the team talking to Luca (AI project manager) to facilitate project progression.

## What we worked on
- Prioritising user priorities and converting them into customer user stories.
- Creating persona documents (customer, restaurant, driver, admin/support).

## Observations
- Collaboration was largely synchronous and bottlenecked by one shared device.

## Action ideas (next week)
- Split work so each team member can progress independently between meetings:
  - 1 person: expand/refine Customer stories + acceptance criteria
  - 1 person: draft Restaurant/provider stories
  - 1 person: start Design doc updates (Figma links + UI flows)
  - 1 person: research/testing plan + how we’ll demonstrate iteration feedback
  - 1 person: repo hygiene (issues/PR templates, boards, linking evidence)

## Next meeting
- Friday 10:00 AM — 20/02/2026
