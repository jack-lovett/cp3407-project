# Project Charter — FeedMe (CP3407/CP5507 2026 TR)

## Problem / brief
Build a **website/desktop/mobile** app for **FeedMe**.
Main brief: *act as a software company building a better FoodPanda-style app*.

## Team
- Harley (`harleypool14`)
- Stella (`Amarachukwu-Stella-Nneji`)
- Jack (`jack-lovett`)
- Corey (`Corey-Camilleri`)

## Project manager (OpenClaw assistant)
The assistant acts as **project manager**:
- maintain plans, backlog, and iteration scope
- capture decisions + meeting minutes
- ensure rubric alignment (docs and evidence)
- identify the next best task and unblock the team

## Success criteria (rubric-driven)
- Strong, well-prioritised **user stories** with estimates and rationale
- Justified **architecture + database + UI** designs (with links/screenshots)
- Working deployed solution with iteration-by-iteration feedback
- Solid automated + acceptance testing evidence
- Exemplary GitHub usage: issues, PRs, branches, commits, and traceability
- Clear technical writing on GitHub Pages (easy to navigate for marking)

## Open questions (to resolve early)
- Target platform (web vs mobile vs desktop) and stack
- Hosting/deployment approach (cloud services; e.g., AWS)
- What “better than FoodPanda” means for our chosen USP
- Figma Jam link + permissions (view access for marker)
