# 8) Project Technical Writing

## Goal
Make the project easy to mark:
- clear navigation
- consistent structure
- links to evidence (screenshots, diagrams, deployments)

## Template (we will follow on each page)
Each page should include:
- **Purpose** (1–2 sentences)
- **What we built/decided**
- **Why** (justification)
- **Evidence** (links + screenshots)
- **Next steps**

## Navigation
- Start at `index.md` and follow the rubric links.
