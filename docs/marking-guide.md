Exemplary set of features are correctly planned for implementation in justified order and within given budget. Your IT solution is planning to deliver “what is needed, on time and on budget.” | Few minor errors  | Many minor errors | Few major errors | Many major errors |
| **2: Design**                         | Architectural, database, and user interface designs are exemplary and justified. (See textbook Chapter 5.) Add a page to your GitHub to explain design of all major components.                                                                                                                |                   |                   |                  |                   |
| **3: Implementation / Code**          | Your IT solution delivered “what is needed, on time and on budget” for each iteration. Demonstration and client feedback on deployed solution after each iteration. Exemplary UI, database and deployment choices. Add a page to your GitHub to illustrate/promote your delivered solution.    |                   |                   |                  |                   |
| **4: Test**                           | Exemplary testing of all components. Test-driven development. Acceptance testing of all delivered features. Appropriate testing datasets. Delivered implementation matches the planning. (See Chapters 7, 8 and 9.) Add a page to your GitHub to explain your testing.                         |                   |                   |                  |                   |
