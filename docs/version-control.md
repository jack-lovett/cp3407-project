# 5) Version Control

## Our approach (to show exemplary GitHub usage)
- Use GitHub Issues for work items
- Feature branches per issue: `feature/<short-name>`
- PRs with clear descriptions + screenshots where relevant
- Link PRs ↔ issues ↔ user stories

## Evidence
- Screenshots/links to example PRs
- Branching strategy notes
- Commit conventions
