## Project manager (AI)
This repo uses an OpenClaw assistant as a **project manager** to:
- keep the plan up to date (requirements → design → implementation → testing)
- track progress and unblock next steps
- log decisions and meeting notes
- keep the GitHub Pages documentation aligned to the rubric
