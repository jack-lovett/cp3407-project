# Backlog / Active Tasks

## Active tasks (next up)
- [ ] Generate **Service Provider (Restaurant)** user stories (do not write them yet; schedule/assign at next meeting).
- [ ] Decide team priorities for next meeting: assign each member a clear deliverable, confirm what’s in-scope for Iteration 1 vs Iteration 2.

## Notes
- Keep this file as the lightweight snapshot of "what we’re doing next"; detailed work should live in GitHub Issues/PRs once created.
