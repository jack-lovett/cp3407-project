## Team

## Roles (initial, to confirm)
**We can change these once we choose the tech stack.**
- Product / stakeholder liaison: _TBD_
- UX/UI + Figma owner: _TBD_
- Backend + database owner: _TBD_
- Frontend owner: _TBD_
- QA/testing owner: _TBD_
- DevOps/deployment owner: _TBD_

## PM process (what I will enforce)
- Work is tracked as **GitHub Issues** and linked to user stories.
- Every meaningful change goes through a **PR** with a short description + screenshots where relevant.
- Decisions are recorded in `decisions.md`.
- Meetings are recorded in `docs/meetings/` with action items + owners.

## Definition of Done (lightweight)
- Feature implemented
- Basic tests (unit/integration) added where sensible
- Documentation updated (especially GitHub Pages)
- Evidence captured (screenshots, links, feedback) per iteration
