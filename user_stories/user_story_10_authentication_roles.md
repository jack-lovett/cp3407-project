# User story title: Authentication and role-based access

## Priority: 40
High-level (iteration-agnostic).

## Estimation:
TBD (planning poker).

## Assumptions (if any):
- Users have different roles (e.g., Customer, Restaurant, Admin/Support).
- A lightweight approach may be used initially (e.g., basic login), then hardened later.

## Description:
Description-v1: As a **user** (customer/restaurant/admin), I want to sign up and log in with role-based access, so that my data and actions are secure and appropriate to my role.

## Tasks
1. Define roles and permissions (what each role can view/do).
2. Define authentication approach (local accounts vs third-party).
3. Add login/logout UI and basic access control.

# UI Design:
- Link/attach Figma frame once confirmed.

# Completed:
-
